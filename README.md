This is simple AngularJS just to demonstrate programming skills in front-end.

## What is it about?

Is is a simple application which shows the list of users from where you can View, Edit or Remove a User.

## What functions are implemented?

Since there is no back-end involved I used localStorage to store users data. All CRUD operations are implemented I have also implemented a function that, returns GitHub Repositories based on given GitHub Account.

For example, when you click on view button of a user there you can see Online Repositories.

## Quick Start

For starting quick I've pre-created a list of users which will be loaded on localstorage at the moment you visit the application. Then you can manipulate datas.
